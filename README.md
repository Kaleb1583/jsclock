dragon731012 is the original creator ^^^

originally i was looking for some bookmarklets to run

(bookmarklets = bookmarks but instead of a url its code that starts with 'javascript:' and it runs the js code on click)

and you can see its a little different from the original code since im currently adding a drag feature that allows the clock div to be moved across the screen to anywhere or any corner.
